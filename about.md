## What is ECESS?

Actually, ECESS is all about **YOU-**  the students!

The **ECE Student Society** (ECESS) represents **undergraduate** Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) students at the University of British Columbia. With over 1000 members, we are the largest of all engineering departmental clubs. We collaborate with the **ECE Department** and the **Engineering Undergraduate Society** (EUS) to provide the best professional development, soical, and academic events and services for out students.
