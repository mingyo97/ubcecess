## ECE Lounge

By far one of the best services ECESS provides, the ECE Lounge is located in **Room 434** of the **Macleod** building.

The ECE Lounge contains a **pool table, foosball table**, an **HD TV** (we have cable!), an arcade machine, and over **7 couches**, and a surround sound speaker system enveloping the room, all free and available to use by students at any point during the day.

Right beside the ECE Lounge is the “**lunch room**“, a space shared with the ECE grad society. It contains tables and chairs, along with 2 **vending machines** (one pop, one snack) that is kept stocked by the ECESS, with prices lower than what you would find elsewhere on campus!

## Lockers

We also offer **Locker Rentals** for lockers around McLeod, so you don’t have to carry your heavy textbooks & project parts around with you everywhere! You can rent lockers at a cost of $20 each term by coming to our office located at MCLD **434**. (Lock not provided)
