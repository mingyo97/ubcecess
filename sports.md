Are you interested in being active, having fun, meeting new people, and most importantly NOT studying? If you are then joining an ECE sports team is for you! If you’re not, then joining an ECE sports team is probably a good idea. If you join, you will get a shot at bringing home some awesome championship shirts. Last year many of the teams came close, but lost the finals. Throughout the year there will also be tournaments that you can opt to play in, including tournaments exclusive to the engineering faculty! Lastly, we would like to mention it’s FREE to play, so what more should we say?

For the 2016-2017 school year we’ll be offering sign up for Volleyball, Basketball, Ultimate Frisbee, and Futsal. With the late September deadlines fast approaching, now would be a good time to sign the form linked below.

**Who can play?**

Any engineering student can play, and a maximum of 3 imports are permitted per team. Imports can be staff, students from another department, or faculty.

**Sign up**

Follow this [LINK](https://goo.gl/forms/kVRBHSwJKR2PntYC3.) and fill out the form to sign up. Playing is FREE the only potential cost is an optional jersey.

**Commitment**

Worried about juggling school and sports?
Not to worry, the commitment for each sport is 1 game once a week. Or worry, if you’re still too busy! Also, you will need to show up for at least 2 games to be eligible for play offs.
Worried that the days of play will conflict with another commitment?
You can check out the days and times of play [HERE](http://www.recreation.ubc.ca/files/2014/08/DaysofPlay.pdf) to make sure you don’t have any conflicts.

Lets win some shirts!
