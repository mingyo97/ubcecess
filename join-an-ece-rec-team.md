**IMG of Join an ECE REC Team goes here**

We have 3 teams to sign up for this term. The fall season **begins week of September 24th** and **ends November 23rd**. Games are once per week, and there are playoffs at the end. **Deadline to sign up is Wednesday September 18!**

Practices are optional, to be decided per team Captain. Register now, because it’s on a first come first serve basis; once spots fills up it’s done.

While these are men’s leagues, females are welcome to join as well. In fact, we encourage it!

If you have any further questions, please email [sportsandcharity@ubcecess.com](mailto:sportsandcharity@ubcecess.com)
