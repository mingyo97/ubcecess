### Social

**Ohmcoming IMG goes here**

**Ohmcoming**

Ohmcoming is our oldest traditional Electrical Engineering event, where we test our skills as a true EE. Yes, that means bzzr and soldering. When you add the two you get our famous Resister Races. Where teams of 4 go head to head in a competition of chugging and soldering. Come see what the fuss is all about if you’re new, and defend your title if you’re old.


**E-Week (EUS) IMG goes here**

**E-Week (EUS)**

EUS’s E-week is when all engineering students come out to show our pride. Each year, ECE participates in a week-long competition against all other departments to prove ourselves as the best! Classic events includes: Foreplay, Skulk Night, True Engineer and Red Knight. For details on the week, watch for the E-Week edition of the nEUSpaper or check out the [EUS Website](http://www.ubcengineers.ca/) for details.


**Games Night IMG goes here**

**Games Night**

Games Night is an event held regularly throughout the year in our Lounge (Room 434). Main activities include game tournaments(Foosball, Poker, Pool), video games(Heroes of Newerth, Starcraft, League of Legends) and boardgames(Blokus, Scrabble, Pictionary and Catan) and many more! Don’t really play games? No Worries! You can just come to relax on the couch, mingle with other students and enjoy the cheap pizza and pop!


### Academic

**Beef & Pizza IMG goes here**

**Beef & Pizza**

Beef and Pizza is one of the larger academic events the ECE Student Society holds. The society invites both ECE students and professors to a meeting, where students can talk to profs about concerns they have with the curriculum, as well as receiving free pizza and pop.


**Tutoring IMG goes here**

**Tutoring**

Tutoring is another large portion of the academic portfolio; at the end of each term, tutoring packages covering material in some of the more difficult classes within the 2nd/3rd/and 4th year required courses, are sold to students, and act as final exam booklets, as well as “tickets” to tutoring sessions for the same courses.
